# Skill Scheme

Skill Scheme is a class-builder PvP addon for Minecraft.  The plugin attempts improve combat by introducing dozens of new skills. These skills can be combined in one of five unique classes.

Although many skills come baked into the plugin, the plugin itself is fundamentally a skills *engine*. Much effort has been expended in making sure it is easy to add, balance, and remove skills.

## Inspiration
The inspiration for Skill Scheme comes from [Minplex Champions](https://www.mineplex.com/games/champions/). 

## See it in Action

This is hopelessly out of date, but I recorded this private [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHUul4Qp0wg) which shows the general idea.

## Server 

The Server folder contains an in-progress server (world, etc)

## Developing 

This plugin was originally developed for *spigot*, around 2019/2020. In the latest iteration I'm attempting to use [paper](https://papermc.io/software/paper) for 1.20 Minecraft.
