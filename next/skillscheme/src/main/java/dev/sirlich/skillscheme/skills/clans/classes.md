## Fighter (Knight Clone)

Masters of defense, they use abilities to block (Defensive Stance on sword,) deflect attacks (Deflection on passive) or lock people in place (Bulls Charge on axe, or Hilt Smash on sword.) Their passives help them block, deflect, and take hits more easily. However they also have options to play more offensively, by using Hilt Smash on sword, as well as the following passives of Swordsmanship and Vengeance. Knight can take on multiple opponents at a time when using the passives Level Field and Cleave. 

## Warlock (Mage Clone)

Master of the elements, they use abilities to transform the area and do massive splash damage. Their passives help them keep enemies at a distance while dealing damage or creating area of effects. However, being hugely reliant on their abilities, they should avoid falling into water whilst in battle. It can also be a Defensive/Support class due to its Void, Life Bonds, or Arctic Armor skill.

Mage has the most versatile skill set in the game. Most Mage builds revolve around a certain element, but other combinations work just as well. Mage's low armor equals out it's powerful moves, but Mage can still engage in a melee battle and win. Most of mage's abilities have multiple uses, like for defense or getting to high places. 

## Ranger

Master of range and weaker at melee. They use their abilities to deal massive amounts of damage from safe positions, as well as getting away and/or killing melee enemies quickly. Their passives upgrade their bow, making them deal more damage at range or racking up massive damage combos. Rangers also receive a bow ability which can be prepared as the next arrow fired by left clicking their bow. Bow abilities can help put debuffs on enemies like fire, slowness, and nausea, as well as support teammates(Healing Arrow). For rangers, the axe and sword abilities barely help their combat, but help them move around and jump to good archery positions, as well as escaping melee-based enemies. They perform best against Mages due to the fact that they can kill off a Mage before it has a chance to use AoE affects up close. They perform poorly against Assassins, who have the speed and agility to dodge arrows and move in close with a sword. 

## Rogue (Assassin Clone)

Masters of surprise and quick kills, they use abilities to get around or confuse targets. Their passives help them deliver more damage (Combo Attack) or surprise the enemy (Viper Strikes and Shocking Strikes). They have the highest damage but also the lowest armor. They also have arrows & bows with abilities that helps hinder their enemies (Smoke Arrow and Silencing Arrow,) or increase their next attack (Marked for Death.) They stall in combat by using Evade or Illusion of their choice, and can also escape easily by Leaping, Blinking, or Flashing away. They can also blind opponents around them (Smoke Bomb,) or teleport away where they were brief moments ago (Recall.)

However assassin's mobility is easily nullified if slowed, and thus cannot use it's axe skills for mobility boost (Leap, Blink, Flash.) They're also very squishy as mentioned earlier, dying in 5 hits from iron and gold weapons, and 4 hits in diamond weapons.
